## Sin - Cosine generator

I tried to implement the sin-cos generator using verilog implementation which was originally explained in Kirk Weedman's video.

* The atan table was generated by a python script as explained by Kirk Weedman. There are a few differences between the original atan table and the python generated ones, which basically happened when the value inside the python script is converted into an integer and then converted into binary.

* This repo contains both my implemented version's and original version's verilog design code and the testbench code. 

* I included the vsd file which can be used to view the waveforms in the GTKWave 

### Commands

#### To install iverilog and gtkwave on ubuntu20.04

`sudo apt-get install iverilog gtkwave -y`

#### To run the testbench
```
iverilog -o cordic cordic.v cordic_tb.v
vvp cordic
gtkwave cordic.vcd

```
